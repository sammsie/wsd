	<h3>Creating Harry</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
	"According to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous protagonist came while waiting for a 
	delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. She stated that her idea for 'this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled 
	boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.' While developing the ideas for her book, she also 
	decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with 
	The Guardian: 'Harry had to be an orphan  — so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, 
	disappointing them ... Hogwarts has to be a boarding school  — half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's 
	the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what 
	Hogwarts offers Harry.'
	</p>
	<p>
	Her own mother's death on 30 December 1990 inspired Rowling to write Harry Potter as a boy longing for his dead parents, 
	his anguish becoming 'much deeper, much more real' than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself. In a 2000 
	interview with The Guardian, Rowling also established that the character of Wart in T. H. White's novel The Once and 
	Future King is 'Harry's spiritual ancestor.' Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as
	 her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: 'he came just out of a part 
	 of me.'
	 </p>
	<p>
	Rowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. 'The advantage of a fictional 
	hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet [...]
	if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.'
